# Search Screen Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the search screen to enhance web compatibility, performance with large ingredient lists, and overall user experience.

## Fixed Issues

1. **Web Compatibility**

   - Removed duplicate code and redundant nested scrolling structures to prevent Sliver/RenderViewport errors
   - Fixed layout overflow issues with the ingredient selection grid
   - Optimized UI for both mobile and web platforms

2. **Ingredient Selection**

   - Improved ingredient filtering for large datasets with a proper search bar
   - Added category tabs for easier ingredient browsing
   - Limited ingredients per category to improve performance
   - Added feedback when ingredients are loading or when search returns no results
   - Normalized ingredient names on backend to reduce duplicates

3. **Performance Improvements**

   - Added loading states and error handling for all API requests
   - Optimized rendering of large ingredient lists using paging
   - Fixed memory leak issues by properly cleaning up controllers on dispose
   - Added proper pull-to-refresh functionality for ingredient lists

4. **UI/UX Improvements**

   - Added proper animation for ingredient selection
   - Improved search result cards with better image handling and error fallbacks
   - Enhanced recent searches management with proper persistence
   - Added clear visual feedback for selected ingredients and search results
   - Implemented proper handling for empty states and error states

5. **Data Integration**
   - Connected to real API data instead of mock data
   - Added proper error handling for API failures
   - Improved search algorithm on the backend to return better results
   - Added ingredient normalization on the backend to improve match quality
